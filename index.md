This project revives and modernizes the development experience for **AMX Mod X** scripters. If you love creating plugins for Half-Life, Counter-Strike 1.6, and other GoldSrc mods but miss modern tools, this extension is for you.

It turns VS Code into a powerful IDE for Pawn, bringing features that were previously exclusive to newer languages.

## ✨ What's New (v1.1.9)

### Fixed
- Fixed Autocomplete displaying irrelevant suggestions (fuzzy search) when typing function parameters. The logic was changed to a strict "starts with" search, resulting in cleaner and more accurate suggestions.

---

## ✨ Key Features

This extension goes far beyond simple syntax highlighting. It offers a complete **Language Server** with:

- **Advanced IntelliSense:** Autocomplete for functions, constants, and variables.
- **Smart Code Navigation (`Go to Definition`):** Press `Ctrl+Click` to instantly jump to the definition of:
  - Functions (including `public`, `stock`, `native`, and those with an `@` prefix).
  - Constants defined with `#define`.
  - Global variables.
  - **Functions in Tasks:** Navigate directly to the function when its name is passed as a string (e.g., `set_task_ex(..., "my_function", ...)`).
- **Hover Information:** Hover over a function or variable to see its full definition without leaving your current context.
- **Real-time Diagnostics:** The extension warns you if an `#include` cannot be found, helping you fix errors before you even compile.
- **Integrated Compilation:** Compile your plugins directly from VS Code with a single command.

## 🚀 Installation

1. Install [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/).
2. Open the **Extensions** tab (`Ctrl+Shift+X`).
3. Search for `AMXXPawn Language Service`.
4. Click **Install**.
5. Reload VS Code and enjoy.

You can also install it directly from the [Marketplace page](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=iceeedR.amxx-pawn-language-editor).

## ⚙️ Configuration (Essential Step)

For the extension to work 100%, you **must** tell it where your AMXX compiler and `include` files are located.

1. Open VS Code Settings (`Ctrl + ,`).
2. Click the "Open settings.json" icon in the upper-right corner.
3. Add the following properties to your `settings.json`:

```json
{
    // Path to the amxxpc compiler executable.
    "amxxpawn.compiler.executablePath": "C:\\path\\to\\your\\compiler\\amxxpc.exe",

    // List of folders where the extension should look for .inc files.
    // ESSENTIAL for "Go to Definition" of native functions to work.
    "amxxpawn.compiler.includePaths": [
        "C:\\path\\to\\your\\compiler\\include"
    ],

    // --- RECOMMENDED SETTING ---
    // For a cleaner and smarter autocomplete experience,
    // disable generic suggestions based on words in the file.
    "editor.wordBasedSuggestions": "off"
}
```

**IMPORTANT for Windows users:** In JSON files, you must use double backslashes (`\\`) or forward slashes (`/`) in paths.

**Practical Example:**

```json
{
    "amxxpawn.compiler.executablePath": "C:/AMXX/compiler/amxxpc.exe",
    "amxxpawn.compiler.includePaths": [
        "C:/AMXX/compiler/include"
    ]
}
```

## ⌨️ Available Commands

Open the Command Palette (`Ctrl+Shift+P`) and type `AMXXPawn` to see the available commands:

- **AMXXPawn: Compile Plugin** — Compiles the currently open `.sma` file using the `executablePath` defined in your settings.
- **AMXXPawn: Compile Plugin Local** — Searches for and uses an `amxxpc.exe` located in the same folder as the `.sma` file you are editing.

## 🛠️ For Developers and Contributors
